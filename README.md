# Colton Allen's Forkify Recipe Application

This was the final project of [Jonas Schmedtmann's extensive 70-hour JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfeAEAbc1ZXQnkB/), in which I received the Certificate of Completion, and I am very happy with the result. This build completely revolutionized the way I viewed Web Devolopment from simply a set of languages to make beautiful websites to actual functioning websites that accomplish a goal, that solve a problem, that manages and manipulates data both internally and externally to assist the user in completing a desired task.

## Technologies used for this build:

#### • HTML5
#### • CSS3
#### • JavaScript (vanilla)
